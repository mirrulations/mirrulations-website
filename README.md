# Mirrulations Website Repo
**Authors:** Seth Coleman, Davin Glynn, Trevor Gray, Nathan Hajel, Terrell Nelson, Giovanny Teran, and Brandon Yang

This repository contains the source code for the Mirrulations Project website. The Mirrulations Project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching and retrieving data from [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/). This website interacts with an AWS API Gateway to fetch and display data based on user input.

### <ins>**How to Set up the Local Development Environment**<ins>
1. Download relevant repos:
```
git clone https://github.com/mirrulations/mirrulations-website.git
```
2. Install the prerequisite npm libraries
```
npm ci (this will install all dependencies in package-lock.json without overwriting)
```
3. Make a _**.env**_ file:
    - Right click in your root directory.
    - Make a new file, name it `.env`.
    - Inside put `VITE_GATEWAY_API_URL=(Your API GATEWAY LINK HERE)`.
    - Your Gateway URL is the output from when you launch it in the API repo, it might look something like “http://127.0.0.1:3000/dummy” or “http://localost:3000/dummy”
    - Also, put in your Cognito Configurations:
        - authority, client_id, redirect_uri, response_type, scope
        - `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=(Cognito Client ID)`
        - `VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=(Cognito User Pool ID)`
    - Save the file and run this command:
```
npm run dev
```

### <ins>**How To Get Environment Variables On Amplify:**<ins>
1. Log on to AWS and go to the [AWS Amplify console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps).
2. Click on your app.
3. On the sidebar on the left, click the down arrow on the right side on _**Hosting**_.
4. Click on _**Environment variables**_.

6. If there is already another environment variable, click _**+ Add new**_ at the bottom at the page.
    1. In the box underneath Variable, put `GATEWAY_API_URL`.
        - Then, in the box underneath Value, put your `AWS API Gateway Link`.
    2. In the next box for Variable, put `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`.
        - Then, underneath Value, put your `Client ID`.
    3. In the next box for Variable, put `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`.
        - Then, underneath Value, put your `User Pool ID`
7. Click _**Save**_.
8. Next go to _**Build Settings**_ and edit this into the settings.

        - npm ci  # Installs dependencies using package-lock.json
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "VITE_GATEWAY_API_URL = $GATEWAY_API_URL" >> .env
        - echo "VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID" = $COGNITO_CLIENT_ID >> .env
        - echo "VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID" = $COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID >> .env
        - npm run build  # Runs Vite's production build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist  # Amplify should deploy only the built files
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*  # Cache node_modules to speed up subsequent builds
```
9. Click _**Save**_.
10. Go back to your deployment and redeploy your application.
    - In the top left, next to the amplify logo, click _**All apps**_.
    - Click on your app.
    - Click on the branch that you want to redeploy.
    - In the top right corner, click _**↺ Redeploy this version**_.

### <ins>**Start Up AWS Amplify For Production:**</ins>
1. On [AWS](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1#) search for _**AWS Amplify**_.
2. When you select AWS Amplify, you will be brought to the [main page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify). Click on _**Deploy an app**_.
3. Under _**Deploy your app**_, select _**GitHub**_.
    - Click _**Next**_.
4. There will be a window that pops up where you have to Authorize GitHub to work with Amplify. _**Allow it**_, and then you should be brought to the next screen.
5. In the _**Select a repository**_ box, find your repository. If you cannot find your repository, click on the _**Update GitHub permissions**_. If you are working in a different GitHub Organization you will have to allow Authorization to that Organization.
6. You will be brought to App Settings. Hit _**Next**_.
7. Check to make sure that everything is there, and hit _**Save and Deploy**_. It will start to create and deploy your Amplify App.
8. Once the domain is [registered](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) through Route 53, go to the Amplify app, and select _**Hosting > Custom Domains**_. Then select the _**Add domain**_ in the top right corner.
9. The domain you are trying to deploy if it has been registered should autopopulate as an option, select the domain, and Configure the domain.
10. No changes need to be made, add domain, and wait. This process can take 5-15 minutes to complete. Now the domain is ready to be accessed. 

### <ins>**Start Up AWS Amplify For Dev Testing**</ins>
1. Head on over to Amplify on [AWS](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1#) search for _**AWS Amplify**_.
2. When you select AWS Amplify, you will be brought to all of your Amplify Apps (if you made the main mirrulations App).
3. At the top right, click on “Create new app”.
4. Select GitHub and authorize Amplify and GitHub if you haven't already.
5. Select your Forked Repository and the branch you are working in.
6. From there, create and deploy the app. 
7. Make sure to get the “Environment Variables” and “Build Settings” from the main Amplify App under “Hosting” and put it within the app your just created, and then redeploy if needed.
8. Key notes: 
   - Make sure on GitHub your fork and branch is synced up to date.
